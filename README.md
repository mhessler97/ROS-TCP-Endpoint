# ROS TCP Endpoint

## Introduction

[ROS](https://www.ros.org/) package used to create an endpoint to accept ROS messages sent from a Unity scene using the [ROS TCP Connector](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ROS-TCP-Connector) scripts.

Instructions and examples on how to use this ROS package can be found on the [Unity Robotics Hub](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-Hub/blob/master/tutorials/ros_unity_integration/README.md) repository.

## ROS2 Topic QoS

Topic publisher and subscriber registration commands may include an optional `qos`
field. Omitting it preserves the existing ROS-TCP behavior: reliable, volatile,
keep-last delivery with depth controlled by `queue_size` (default 10).

The `qos` field may be a preset name:

```json
{
  "topic": "/camera/image",
  "message_name": "sensor_msgs/Image",
  "qos": "sensor_data"
}
```

Or an object containing a preset and individual overrides:

```json
{
  "topic": "/map_metadata",
  "message_name": "nav_msgs/MapMetaData",
  "qos": {
    "preset": "transient_local",
    "reliability": "reliable",
    "durability": "transient_local",
    "history": "keep_last",
    "depth": 1
  }
}
```

Supported presets are `default`, `sensor_data`, `transient_local`, and `latched`.
For every preset, `queue_size` remains the depth fallback and a nested `depth`
value takes precedence.
Supported policy values are:

- Reliability: `system_default`, `reliable`, or `best_effort`.
- Durability: `system_default`, `volatile`, or `transient_local`.
- History: `system_default`, `keep_last`, or `keep_all`.
- Depth: any positive integer.

The legacy publisher registration fields remain supported. In particular,
`"latch": true` now creates a transient-local publisher and retains the configured
number of samples for compatible late-joining subscribers. The same optional QoS
format is accepted by both `__publish` and `__subscribe` commands. A Unity client
subscribing to a latched ROS topic must request `transient_local` durability to
receive samples published before its subscription was created.

## ROS2 Action Support (Preview)

Version 0.8.0 introduces an experimental ROS2 action bridge so Unity experiences can send action goals, stream feedback, and finalize results through the same TCP session used for topics and services. The feature is off by default for older connectors; Unity clients must negotiate the `actions-preview` capability during the handshake and emit the following syscommands before sending the serialized ROS messages:

| SysCommand | Purpose | Next Payload |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| `__action_goal` | Unity → ROS: register an action goal (fields: `action_name`, `goal_id`) | `action_type.Goal` bytes |
| `__action_goal_response` | ROS → Unity: respond to a Unity-sent action goal (fields: `action_name`, `goal_id`, `accepted`, `ros_goal_id`, `message`) | None |
| `__action_feedback` | Unity → ROS: stream feedback (fields: `action_name`, `goal_id`) | `action_type.Feedback` bytes |
| `__action_result` | Unity → ROS: complete execution (fields: `action_name`, `goal_id`, `status`) | `action_type.Result` bytes |
| `__action_cancel` | Unity → ROS: cancel a previously-sent goal (fields: `action_name`, `goal_id`) | None |
| `__action_goal_request` | ROS → Unity: ROS node is delegating goal execution to Unity (fields: `action_name`, `goal_id`) | `action_type.Goal` bytes |
| `__action_cancel_request` | ROS → Unity: ROS node accepted a cancel request; Unity should stop work | None |

Unity connectors that register ROS action clients should emit the goal syscommand followed by the serialized goal payload. The endpoint will deserialize the message, forward it via `rclpy.action.ActionClient`, and propagate feedback/results back over TCP. Conversely, registering Unity-hosted action servers allows ROS clients to trigger gameplay logic: the endpoint wraps `ActionServer` and forwards execute/cancel events to Unity using `__action_goal_request`/`__action_cancel_request`. Feedback/results must be sent back with the matching `goal_id` so ROS goal handles stay in sync.
